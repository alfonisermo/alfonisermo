- 👋 Hi, I’m @alfonisermo
- 👀 I’m a retired computer scientist. I'm currently interested in IoT, Android, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Japanese, Irish, and several computing languages 
all with varying degress of fluency. I am also a musician (tenor banjo, voice, piano). I suppose I could use github for compositions and arrangements... but somehow 
that doesn't seem natural. Maybe if I get back to MIDI-work ;-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning electronics and projects with micro-controllers. Arduino, ESPxxxx, RasberryPi, etc. Also learning 3D printing using Creality Ender 3.
My current project is a second swing at greenhouse control. The first, a few years and a different greenhouse ago, was starting to get complex for an Arduino project.
The current Greenhouse only has exhaust fans, so I went simple. Now I'm working on merging and extending code and concepts into the sphere of my home-control abilities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Dunno, need a 3D print? Or a wacky project to kabitz on? I don't do anything commercial nowadays.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I can be reached by my git username at gmail.com.
